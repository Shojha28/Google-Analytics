Nike Google Analytics Project
Introduction
In this project, I focused on analyzing Nike’s digital performance using Google Analytics data. The goal was to understand how user sessions, marketing channels, devices, and product sales changed over a period of time and to identify key factors influencing revenue growth and user engagement.
This was a business-focused analytics project, so my role was not just to calculate metrics but also to connect data insights to practical recommendations that could improve Nike’s digital marketing strategy, user engagement, and revenue performance.

## What I Focused On
For this project, I specifically focused on:
•	Understanding how user behavior changed year-over-year across key metrics like sessions, session duration, and conversion rates.

•	Analyzing how different marketing channels contributed to traffic and purchases, and identifying which channels were underperforming.

•	Analyzing session behavior across devices (mobile, desktop, tablet) to identify device-specific user experience challenges.

•	Performing a deep dive into revenue trends, identifying high-performing products, and evaluating how product mix shifted over time.

•	Looking at city and gender-specific revenue performance, identifying locations where performance dropped or surged.

•	Providing clear recommendations for Nike’s digital team, covering areas like mobile optimization, channel-specific strategies, and product-level tactics.

## Key Observations from Data Analysis

### 1. Sessions Growth and User Shift
•	Overall sessions increased by 10.4% year-over-year (October 2023 to October 2024).

•	Growth was driven mainly by younger (18-24) and older (65+) users, while middle-aged segments (25-44) saw declines.

•	This indicates a shift in Nike’s digital audience, which could reflect changing marketing focus or product appeal.

### 2. Decline in Average Session Duration
•	Average session duration fell by 19.6%, from 260 seconds to 209 seconds.

•	This drop suggests that users are either finding what they need faster or engagement quality has declined.

•	Mobile session duration improved slightly, but desktop engagement dropped significantly.

### 3. Marketing Channel Performance
•	Direct traffic accounted for 47.2% of sessions in 2023, making it the dominant channel.

•	Organic search contributed 37%, proving the importance of SEO.

•	Paid search, referral, and email combined contributed less than 20%, meaning paid strategies were underutilized.

### 4. Device Trends
•	Mobile sessions dropped sharply, but tablet sessions increased by over 125%.

•	Despite fewer mobile sessions, mobile session quality improved (longer duration per session).

•	Desktop still drove most sessions, but its engagement time declined.

### 5. Revenue Growth
•	Total revenue increased by 73.64%, from $88,763.93 in October 2023 to $154,133.34 in October 2024.

•	This growth reflects successful sales and marketing strategies but also potential external factors like seasonality or new product launches.

### 6. Top Product Analysis
•	The Super G Brick Puzzle Set remained the top-selling product both years, with revenue increasing by 42%.

•	New products like Google Campus Bike and Chrome Dino Holiday Lodge Sweater emerged as strong performers in 2024.

•	The product mix shifted significantly, indicating that product innovation and new launches were key drivers of revenue growth.
________________________________________
### 7. City and Gender Insights
•	In New York, male revenue surged by 357%, but female revenue dropped by 74%.

•	In San Francisco, both genders showed strong growth, with female revenue growing by 434%.

•	Sunnyvale saw revenue decline due to a sharp drop in female revenue (-85.5%).

•	This highlights the need for localized marketing strategies targeted at specific demographics in each city.

### 8. Conversion Rate and AOV
•	Conversion rate improved significantly, contributing 53% of revenue growth.

•	Average Order Value (AOV) increased by 5.12%, from $156.56 to $164.59.

•	This shows that users are buying more expensive items or adding more to their carts.

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, my recommendations for Nike were:
### 1. Optimize for Mobile Users
•	Mobile sessions declined, but engagement quality improved.

•	Focus on faster load times, mobile-first design, and personalized recommendations to attract more mobile users.

### 2. Leverage Paid Channels
•	Paid channels had low contribution to traffic.

•	Develop stronger search ads, social ads, and display campaigns to capture high-intent audiences.

### 3. Re-engage Desktop Users
•	Desktop sessions were high, but engagement time dropped.

•	Improve desktop UI/UX, add interactive product discovery tools, and run targeted desktop promotions.

### 4. Focus on 18-34 Age Group
•	This group is still the largest driver of sessions, so Nike should:

o	Create youth-centric campaigns

o	Launch limited-edition collaborations with influencers

o	Use interactive formats like shoppable videos

### 5. Capitalize on Tablet Surge
•	Tablet sessions grew 125%, but the site may not be fully optimized for tablets.

•	Focus on tablet-friendly layouts, and create campaigns specifically for this audience.

### 6. Product Strategy
•	Double down on high-performing products like Super G Brick Puzzle Set, and refine messaging for new items like Google Campus Bike.

•	Phase out underperformers based on sales data.

### 7. Localized Marketing
•	In cities like Sunnyvale, re-engage female audiences with tailored campaigns.

•	In New York, maintain strong male-focused campaigns while rebuilding female interest.

## Final Reflection
This project taught me how to connect data analysis directly to business outcomes. It was not just about tracking metrics but about understanding why the numbers changed and what Nike could do to improve further.
By combining Google Analytics data with clear business storytelling, I was able to develop recommendations that are practical, data-backed, and directly tied to revenue and engagement goals.
